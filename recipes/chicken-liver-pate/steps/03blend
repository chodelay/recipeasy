Remove the bay leaf and rosemary and spoon the liver mixture into a food processor.
Process until smooth and season to taste with salt and pepper.
Spoon the pâté into ramekins or a pâté pot and cover with plastic wrap, pressing it directly onto the surface of the pâté to prevent it from discolouring.
Chill the pâté overnight in the refrigerator.

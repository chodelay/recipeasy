Over low heat, add oil and sugar to your wok.
Melt the sugar slightly and add the pork.
Raise the heat to medium and cook until the pork is lightly browned.
Turn the heat back down to low and add Shaoxing cooking wine, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and water.
Cover and simmer for up to an hour until pork is fork tender.
Every 5-10 minutes, stir to prevent burning and add more water if it gets too dry.
If there is still a lot of visible liquid, uncover the wok, turn up the heat, and stir continuously until the sauce has reduced to a glistening coating.

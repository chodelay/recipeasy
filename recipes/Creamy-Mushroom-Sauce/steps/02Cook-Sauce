Add sliced mushrooms and stir-fry until they are lightly browned, reduce heat to medium.
Add cream, pepper and a good pinch of salt and bring to a boil.
Cook for 5-8 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent cream from overboiling.
Once the sauce has reduced by half, add crushed garlic, and cook for another 1 minute.
Season with extra salt, if required. Remove from heat and serve over your favourite steaks.

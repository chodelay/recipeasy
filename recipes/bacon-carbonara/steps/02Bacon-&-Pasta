Put pasta on.
Fry the bacon until crisp, then crumble and set aside.
With remaining bacon grease, saute onion and mushrooms until onions are golden. Lower heat if waiting for pasta.
Drain the pasta when cooked and while still warm, add to the onions and mushrooms.
Pour cream mixture into the pasta, and stir over low heat for 1-2 minutes.
Serve with additional Parmesan.

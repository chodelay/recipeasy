Heat a cup or two of water in the wok until boiling. Add about a teaspoon of the oil and blanch the broccoli for about 1 minute. Remove and set aside until ready to fry.
Drain the water from the wok and dry the wok over the flame. Add the 
remaining oil and add the ginger first then the garlic to the oil, then the onion and fry until the onion is  softened. Scoop the onion, garlic and ginger out of the oil and add to the broccoli.
Using the flavoured oil left in the wok, fry the beef in batches until well browned. 
Return all the ingredients back to the wok and toss together. Add the oyster sauce, soy sauce, stock and sugar and toss to coat. Slowly drizzle the 
cornflour mixture into the wok while tossing, until the liquids thicken and cling to the ingredients. Remove to a plate, rest for a minute and serve with rice.

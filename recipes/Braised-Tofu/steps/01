Heat oil in a frying pan and fry the tofu pieces until golden brown. Set aside.
Saut√© garlic and chilis until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Then add vegan fish sauce, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, Shaoxing, sugar, ground white pepper, and water. Mix well and bring to a boil.
Return the tofu to the pan, reduce heat, and simmer until the sauce is reduced by half, about 10 minutes.
Add the scallions, mix well, and cook for another minute. Turn off heat, transfer to a serving plate and serve with steamed white rice.

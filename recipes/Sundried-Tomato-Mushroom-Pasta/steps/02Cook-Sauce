Heat olive oil on medium-high heat, add sliced mushrooms and garlic and cook for about 3 minutes.
Add diced sun-dried tomatoes. Reduce heat.
Carefully add the broth to the skillet - continue to cook the vegetables in a chicken broth on medium heat until the mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes
absorb some of the broth and the broth reduces somewhat.
Add cream and bring to boil just for a short moment.
Add Parmesan cheese and cook the sauce, stirring, for a couple of minutes, on low-medium heat until the cheese melts.
Add the basil.

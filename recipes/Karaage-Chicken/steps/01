Cut chicken in bite size pieces. In a plastic container or large ziploc bag, combine grated ginger, garlic, 
soy sauce and Sake.
Put the chicken in the marinade and mix chicken well. Put the chicken in the fridge for 15 to 20 minutes.
In a deep frying pan or a wok, heat vegetable oil to 180 degree Celsius or 350Â°F
Dust the chicken with potato starch and fry in the oil until golden. To make them really crispy, lift chicken 
from the oil with chopsticks or tongs from time to time so that the chicken will be aired out (so to speak).
